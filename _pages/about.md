Hi! I'm Xinyi Qian, a final year Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering (GeoSystems)](https://geotechnical.berkeley.edu/) at the University of California, Berkeley. I am advised by [Professor Jonathan D. Bray](https://ce.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/bray). I am also fortunate to be coadvised by [Professor F. Estefan T. Garcia](https://cee.engin.umich.edu/people/garcia-f-estefan-t/) from University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. Prior to joining Berkeley, I received my Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) in 2018.
