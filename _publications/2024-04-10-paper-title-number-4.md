Arch-like structures form in granular materials when particles flow through an opening. This phenomenon exists in a wide range of engineering problems such as hoppers and wells. The formation of the statically stable arch is investigated numerically using the discrete element method. Three different geometries are examined in trapdoor simulations to illustrate different applications. Results are provided in terms of the ability to form statically stable arches and particle-level contact force evolution. The overall stability is evaluated further through collapse sensitivity to particle removal and friction reduction. Particle interactions determine the characteristics of arch formation. The density of the particle assemblage greatly affects the statically stable arch formation, its shape, its force network structure, and its stability. Particle size distribution, especially the proportion of large-size particles, largely determines the critical size of the trapdoor that enables the formation of a statically stable arch. Nonspherical particle shape affects the critical size of the trapdoor and the arch shape. Several methods of identifying particles that are worth investigating are examined, including a new method. Key insights and possible further improvements are shared.
