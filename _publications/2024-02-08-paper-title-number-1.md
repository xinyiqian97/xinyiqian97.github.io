Discrete element simulations are performed to investigate soil arching due to downward trapdoor displacement. The simulations varied soil relative density, trapdoor width, soil height, particle shape, and particle contact properties to examine the mechanisms of soil arching. Results are quantified in terms of the reduction of normal stress on the trapdoor, the redistribution of stresses within the soil, force chain networks, and particle kinematics affecting the soilâ€™s volumetric and shear responses to the trapdoor displacement. Shearing and dilation of the soil contribute primarily to the deformation mechanisms induced in the soil from the trapdoor displacement. Dense soil dilates and expands to fill in the space created by trapdoor movement which minimizes the surface manifestations of trapdoor displacement. Narrower trapdoors produce smaller ground surface settlements and greater load reduction on the trapdoor. Analysis of the force chains that develop in an arc above the trapdoor show shear stresses increase in the soil above the trapdoor as the net confining stress decreases. The initial development of the arc pattern within the soil depends greatly on relative density. Inevitably, the arc collapses and two arcs developed at large trapdoor displacements regardless of the soil density.
